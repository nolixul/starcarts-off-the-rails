# StarCarts off the Rails

A website with collections of star wars related trivia, sourced from [swapi](https://swapi.py4e.com/api/). You can create a collection of your favourite films, characters and starships at the top of the page!

## Future functionality
- I plan to fix the favourites function so you can remove favourites
- I plan to implement some unit testing
- I plan to add some filters
- Some other ideas include adding new endpoints, improving the UI and seperating out the favourites per page
